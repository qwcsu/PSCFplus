A good way to become familiar with the PSCF simulation programs is to run a few example simulations and examine the associated input and output files.
A set of examples containing input files for PSCF simulations are provided  in the pscfpp/examples directory of the PSCF repository.

Each top level subdirectory of the examples root directory contains examples of simulations of a particular program or set of closely related program. 
For example, the pcNd directory contains examples that use the pscf_pc1d, pscf_pc2d or pscf_pcNd CPU programs for periodic microstructres.
The next level of subdirectory specifies a type of physical system. For example, the pscf_pcNd/diblock/ subdirectory contains examples of computations involving diblock copolymer melts. 
Lower level subdirectories contain specific examples.

\section examples_layout_sec Input files

The input files for each example are in a separate directory, which we will refer to as an example directory.  
Each example directory contains a set of input files that include at least one parameter file, a command file and an input chemical potential file.
Generally, the parameter file is named "param" and the command file is named "command".

A typical example directory contains files and subdirectories with the following names:
\code
    param
    commands
    run
    clean
    in/
       omega
    out/
\endcode
Here, in/ and out/ are names of subdirectories. The file in/omega is the input chemical potential field.
The out/ subdirectory is initially empty. The files named "run" and "clean" are unix shell scripts
that users may execute to run the simulation and clean up afterwards, respectively.

\section examples_simulate_sec Running an example

Users may run example simulations either by running the "run" script that is provided with most
examples, or by invoking the relevant simulation program from the command line. 

To use a "run" script, simply issue the command
\code
  > .\run
\endcode
from within the directory containing the example and the "run" file. 

To use pscf_pc3d to run a simple example computation with the above 
directory structure, one could change directory (cd) to the main directory 
for the example and issue the command 
\code
    > pscf_pc3d -e -p param -c command 
\endcode
This command would send log output to the terminal.  To run the calculation
in background and redirect the log output to a file out/log one would 
instead type
\code
    > pscf_pc3d -e -p param -c command > out/log &
\endcode
Commands to use a different program are similar except for the replacement
of pscf_pc3d by the appropriate executable name.
