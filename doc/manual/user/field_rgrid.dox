PSCF can also output the values of set of fields in a format
that gives values on the nodes of the regular grid that is 
used by the pseudo-spectral algorithm for solving the modified 
diffusion equation.

<h3> Example: 2D Hex Phase </h3>

Here is example of a converged omega field for a hex phase of
a diblock copolymer melt:

<h3> File Format </h3>

Like other field formats, this file format contains a header 
section with crystallographic information followed by a data section. 
The header section is similar that for the symmetry adapted format, except 
that the last variable is an array "ngrid" of integers giving the number
of grid points in each direction. In this example, because it is a
two-dimensional crystal (dim = 2), this array contains two numbers,
both 24, indicating a grid in which there are 24 grid points along
each coordinate axis. To describe a hexagonal phase, we use a 
non-orthogonal coordinate system in which each axis is parallel to 
one of the Bravais lattice vectors, which in a hexagonal phase have 
an angle of 60 degrees between them.

The data section contains the values of fields associated with N_monomer 
monomer types at grid points given by
\f[

    \textbf{r}(n_1, \ldots, n_{D}) = \sum_{i=1}^{\textrm{D}}
    \frac{n_{i}}{N_{i}}\textbf{a}_{1}

\f]
where \f$D\f$ is the dimensionality of the crystal (denoted by "dim" 
in the header file), \f$\textbf{a}_{i}\f$is a Bravais lattice vector, 
\f$N_{i}\f$ is the number of grid points along direction \f$i\f$, and 
\f$n_{i}\f$ is an integer index in the range \f$0 \leq n_{i} < N_{i}\f$.  
The number of rows in the data section is equal to the total number 
of grid points. Each row in this section contains values of all field 
components at a single grid point. The number of columns is equal to 
the number of monomer types, so that data in column \f$\alpha\f$ 
contains the values of the field associated with monomer type 
\f$\alpha\f$. 

Grid points are listed in order using index \f$n_{1}\f$ as the most 
rapidly varying (innermost) loop index. This is implemented in the 
field_io_mod module, in subroutines output_field_grid and 
input_field_grid as a fortran loop of the form::

\code
   do n3 = 0, ngrid(3) - 1
     do n2 = 0, ngrid(2) - 1
       do n1 = 0, ngrid(1) - 1
          [Read or write data at grid point r(n1, n2, n3)]
       enddo
     enddo
   enddo
\endcode
