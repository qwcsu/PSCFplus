Here is a example of a minimal command file for pscf_fd:
\code
ITERATE          in/w
WRITE_W    out/w.bf
WRITE_C    out/c.bf
FINISH
\endcode
The command "ITERATE in/w.bf" instructs the program to read the file 
in/w.bf, which contains an initial guess for the chemical potential 
field, then iteratively solve the self-consistent field equations 
start from this initial guess.  The command "WRITE_W out/w.bf" 
writes the resulting converged set of chemical potential fields to 
the file out/w.bf. The command "WRITE_C out/c.bf" writes the 
corresponding monomer volume fraction fields to the file out/c.bf.
The script stops execution when it encounters the FINISH command.
