The source code for the C++/CUDA version of PSCF is hosted on the github 
server, at <a href=http://github.com>github</a>, as project dmorse/pscfpp.  
The source code may be obtained by using a git version control manager to 
clone the public <a href=https://github.com/dmorse/pscfpp>git repository</a>. 
The following instructions assume that a "git" client has been installed 
on your computer.

\section compile_getcode_section Cloning the repository

To obtain a working copy of the pscfpp git repository, you should first
change directory (cd) to the directory you want to contain the pscfpp
root directory. From there, then enter the command
\code
> git clone --recursive https://github.com/dmorse/pscfpp.git
\endcode
This should create a complete working copy of the PSCF source code 
in a new subdirectory named "pscfpp/" of the directory from which you 
invoked the above command.

The above instructions are for users who simply want to get a copy of 
PSCF their own use, but who are not (or not yet) interested in sharing 
modifications of the code with others. Users that want to be able to 
contribute to the project or share their extensions or improvements of 
PSCF with others should go through a slightly more complicated 
procedure. Such users should instead:
<ul>
<li> Create a user account on github.com, if they do not already have one.</li>
<li> Create a fork (i.e., a personal version) of the pscfpp repository in their github user account</li>
<li> Clone their copy of pscfpp to a computer on which they can compile 
and edit the code, using the --recursive option and using a communication 
protocol that is set up to allow them write access. </li>
</ul>

Herefafter, we assume that the root directory of the pscfpp working copy 
is named pscfpp/.  References to paths that do not start explicitly with 
a prefix "pscfpp/" should be understood to be relative paths, relative 
to this directory. The directory structure of the pscfpp repository is 
explained \ref developer_source_page "here".

\section compile_submodules_section Use of git submodules

Some subdirectories of the pscfpp/src directory are maintained in 
separate github repositories and are imported into pscfpp as git
"submodules". (See chapter 7.11 of the Pro Git online book). Specifically, 
the src/util and src/tests directories are submodules that contain clones 
of the dmorse/util and dmorse/test repositories on github, respectively. 

The use of the "--recursive" option of the git clone command given above 
should automatically create clones of these submodules in the appropriate 
locations within the pscfpp source directory tree, creating a complete 
functional copy of the source code. Cloning a copy of pscfpp without 
using the "--recursive" option, however, would create a version of the 
pscfpp directory tree in which the src/util and src/tests directories 
are empty. If you find yourself with a repository clone in which one or 
both of these repositories is empty, you can either clone pscfpp again 
with the recursive option, or read chapter 7.11 of the online Pro Git 
book for instructions on how to manually fetch and update these submodules.
