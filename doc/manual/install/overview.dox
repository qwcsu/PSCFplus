Below is a brief overview of instructions for compiling all of the PSCF 
programs using default settings. The directions given here and in 
subsequent pages assume that you have cloned the PSCF repository and
installed all required dependencies, and that the root directory of the 
repository is named pscfpp/. 

Instructions:

   - **Set environment variables:**
     Modify the users PATH and PYTHONPATH unix environment variables,
     as discussed \ref install_environment_page "here".

   - **Navigate to root directory:**
     Change directory (cd) to the pscfpp/ root directory.

   - **Setup:**
     Invoke the "setup" script from the pscfpp/ root directory.  Enter 
     the command
     \code 
     > ./setup
     \endcode
     to setup the build system with default compiler options. Alternatively,
     invoke the setup with a filename argument for non-default compiler
     options (as discussed \ref install_setup_page "here").

   - **Change directory to the build directory:**
     Change directory (cd) to the pscfpp/bld subdirectory, by entering
     "cd bld" from the root directory.

   - **Compile all cpu programs:** From pscfpp/bld, enter
     \code
     > make all-cpu
     \endcode
     This will create generate a large number of intermediate object 
     (*.o), dependency (*.d) and library (*.a) files in subdirectories of
     the pscfpp/bld directory, and install executables named "pscf_fd, 
     "pscf_pc1d", "pscf_pc2d" and "pscf_pc3d" in the pscfpp/bin directory.

   - **Compile GPU accelerated program:** To compile the GPU accelerated
     executables on a machine with an appropriate NVIDIA GPU and a CUDA
     compiler, invoke
     \code
     > make pspg
     \endcode
     If successful, this will install executables named "pscf_pg1d", 
     "pscf_pg2d" and "pscf_pg3d" in the pscfpp/bin directory.

Each of the above steps is discussed in more detail in the following pages.
