Each subdirectory of this directory contains an example 
of a three-dimensional periodic phase that can be run on
a GPU using pscf_pg3d program. To run these examples, 
you must be logged onto a computer or node with an NVIDIA
GPU and a CUDA run time environment. 

The command line interface to run a CUDA program contains 
extra parameters to specify the use of threads. The syntax 
in all of the example given here is

>  pscf_pg3d -e -p param -c command -1 nblock -2 nthread

Parameters param and command are the names of the parameter 
and command files for each example.  The argument nblock of 
option -1 sets the number of CUDA blocks, while argument 
nthread of option -2 sets the number of threads per block. 
The nblock x nthread should always chosen to be equal to 
the number of grid points in the mesh used to discretize
a unit cell. The number of grid points in each direction
is specified in the param file. 

Each of these example directories contains an executable
script named "run" that contains the appropriate form 
of the above command, including the correct values for
nblock and nthread. To run an example, you can thus just
invoke "./run" from the directory containing the
