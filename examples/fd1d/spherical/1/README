Examples in this directory simulate a spherical micelle of AB diblock
copolymers (length N=1.0, N_A = 0.125) in a B hompolymer solvent 
(length N=1.0) with chi chosen to give a CMC of about 0.5 % by volume
(0.005 volume fraction). Input files are given for several different
closely related simulations:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Simulation #1: Canonical, near CMC

The parameter and command files param.c and command solve the canonical
ensemble SCFT equations for a micelle at conditions very near its cmc,
as defined as the point where the SCFT excess grand free energy is zero. 
To run this simulation enter

>   pscf_fd -e -p param.c1 -c command.1

or (to redirect log output to a file)

>   pscf_fd -e -p param.c1 -c command.1  > log

Resulting output concentration and chemical potential files are out/c
and out/w. Block concentrations are written to out/b. The constrained
partition functions q(s,z) and q^{+}(s,z) evaluated at the junction 
and their product q q^{+} are written to file out/c.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Simulation #2: Grand Canonical, near CMC

The parameter and command files param.g and command solve the same
problem in grand canonical problem. To run this simulation enter

>   pscf_fd -e -p param.g1 -c command.1

Output concentration and chemical potential files and other output
files are again written to directory out, with the same file names
as in simulation example 1.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Simulation #3: Canonical Composition Sweep, Down from CMC

The parameter and command files param.s and command.s peform a 
composition sweep in canonical ensemble that starts from the same 
near-cmc conditions as the above two simulations and performs a 
sweep of decreasing total copolymer concentration. This is a much
longer simulation than simulations #1 and #2 - be prepared to wait 
a few minutes for it to finish. To run this simulation, enter:

>   pscf_fd -e -p param.csl -c command.s1

Output files are placed in the csl/ subdirectory. The file csl/log 
is a summary file with one line of basic thermodynamic information 
per state point. 

Comment: This sweep ends near the minimum attainable total copolymer 
concentration for this system in this simulation cell. The micelle size 
(excess of copolymer) in a system with significant molecular solubility
is a multivalued function of total concentration. Equivalently, the 
total concentration is a non-monotonic function of micelle size, which
reaches a mininum at some critical micelle size that depends on the 
volume of the simulation domain. This is a result of the fact that the 
concentration of dissolved copolymers increases with decreasing micelle 
size for small micelles, below an inflection point in the excess free 
energy curve, and that dissolved copolymer becomes a substantial fraction 
of the total in a system with a small micelle and signicant solubility. 
Because the total concentration in a finite simulation domain is 
dominated by the excess for sufficiently large micelles (or small domains) 
and by the dissolved copolymer contribution for small micelles (or 
large domains), the excess micelle size in a system with significant 
solubility increases with increasing total concentration for larger 
micelles but increases with decreasing total concentration below a 
critical size. The change in behavior occurs at a critical micelle 
size at which the total copolymer concentration is minimum. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Simulation #4: Grand-Canonical Sweep, Small Micelles

The parameter and command files param.s and command.s peform a 
composition sweep in grand-canonical ensemble that starts from 
the end of the sweep produced by Simulation #3 and sweeps out a
curve of increasing copolymer chemical potential and decreasing
micelle size that extends to the region of small, subcritical 
micelles. To run this simulation, enter:

>   pscf_fd -e -p param.gs -c command.s2

Output files are placed in the gs/ output subdirectory. The file 
gs/log is a summary file with one line of basic thermodynamic 
information per state point.
