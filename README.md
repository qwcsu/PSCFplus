# PSCF - Polymer Self-Consistent Field Theory (C++/CUDA)

PSCF is a package of software for solving the Edwards-Helfand 
self-consistent field theory (SCFT) of polymer liquids. The version 
described here is written primarily in C++, with GPU accelerated code 
in CUDA.  This C++/CUDA version of PSCF is still under development, 
but is intended to eventually supersede the existing PSCF Fortran 
program. The older Fortran program is maintained in a separate 
github.com repository at https://github.com/dmorse/pscf.

The C++/CUDA version of PSCF is free, open source software. It is 
distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License as (GPL) 
published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the 
License or (at your option) any later version.  PSCF is distributed

## Overview

Differences between the C++/CUDA version of PSCF and the older Fortran 
version and expected advantages of the new code include:

   - PSCF (C++/CUDA) is an extensible package of several different 
     programs designed for use with different geometries, boundary 
     conditions, algorithms or hardware, designed around a common 
     framework. 

   - PSCF (C++/CUDA) enables simulations of mixtures containing arbitrary 
     acyclic branched copolymers, in addition to the linear block 
     copolymers and linear homopolymers allowed by the Fortran PSCF code.

   - Adoption of C/C++ as a base language has simplified implementation 
     of variant that that uses graphical process units (GPUs).

## Programs

Currently, the package contains the following SCFT solvers:

   - A one-dimensional finite difference solver for problems that involve 
     variation in a single spatial coordinate in Cartesian, cylindrical 
     or spherical coordinates.

   - A CPU-based pseudo-spectral solver for periodic microstructures that 
     are periodic in 1, 2, or 3 coordinates.

   - A analogous GPU accelerated pseudo-spectral solver for period 
     microstructures in 1, 2 or 3 dimensions.

The one-dimensional finite difference solver is useful for treating 
problems involving flat or curved interfaces, as well as cylindrical or 
spherical copolymer micelles. The executable for this program is named 
pscf_fd.

The pseudo-spectral CPU solver for periodic microstructures is closely
analogous to the older PSCF Fortran program, and provides a similar 
level of performance. Like the Fortran program, it allows the user to 
search for a solution with any specified crystal system type and space 
group symmetry, and provides efficient algorithms to relax the unit cell 
parameters so as to minimize the free energy.  The new code can read and 
write the same file formats for representing a field as the PSCF Fortran
code, including a format based on an expansion in symmetry-adapted basis 
functions and one based on values of fields at regularly spaced grid 
points. Currently, the most important features of the Fortran code that 
have not yet been reimplemented in the new code are the "sweep" 
continuation feature and specialized code to represent point-particle 
solvents. Different executable files are used to solve 1, 2 and 3 
dimensionally periodic structures, which are named pscf_pc1d, pscf_pc2d 
and pscf_pc3d, respectively. Here, "pc" stands for "periodic CPU".

The GPU-accelerated pseudo-spectral solver for periodic structures is 
based on algorithms similar to those used in the CPU pseudo-spectral 
code, but is somewhat less mature. Like the corresponding C++/CUDA CPU 
code, the GPU-accelerated code allows the use of any unit cell type, 
including no-orthogonal unit cells, and provides automatic relaxation 
of unit cell parameters. The most important difference in features is 
that the GPU-accelerated code does yet allow the user to use a
representation in symmetry-adapted basis functions to constrain the 
space group symmetry of the structure. The GPU accelerated programs 
for solving 1, 2 and 3 dimensionally periodic structures are named 
pscf_pg1d, pscf_pg2d and pscf_pg3d, respectively, where "pg" stands 
for "periodic GPU".

## Getting the source code

The PSCF C++/CUDA source code is maintained in the github repository

   <https://github.com/dmorse/pscfpp>.

It may be obtained by using a git version control system client to
clone the repository. To do so on a machine with a git client, 
enter the command:
``` 
git clone --recursive https://github.com/dmorse/pscfpp.git
```
Note the use of the --recursive option to the git clone command.
This is necessary to clone several git submodules that are maintained
in separate repositories. This command will create a new directory 
called pscfpp/ that contains all of the source code and associated
documentation, including all required git submodules.

## Documentation

PSCF is distributed with source files for an html web manual.
After cloning the source code, you can use the doxygen documentation
generation program to generate a local copy of this documentation. 
To do this, doxygen must be installed on your computer, and the 
directory containing the doxygen executable must be in your command 
search PATH. To generate documentation:

   - Change directory (cd) to the pscfpp/ root directory

   - Enter "make html"

This should create many html files in the pscfpp/doc/html directory.
To begin reading the documentation, point a browser at the file
pscfpp/doc/html/index.html, which is the main page of the manual.

## Dependencies

The PSCF source code is written in a combination of C++ and (for
the GPU accelerated program) CUDA, and must be compiled from source.
The package was developed on linux and and Mac OS X operating systems 
using standard unix utilities, and is designed to run on these 
systems. To compile linux-like software on a Mac, you must first 
install the XCode Mac development environment and the unix command 
line tools.  

The CPU-based programs within the PSCF package depend on the 
following external libraries:

  - Gnu scientific library (GSL)

  - FFTW fast Fourier transform library

The one-dimensional finite difference program pscf_fd requires only 
GSL, and not FFTW. The CPU-based programs for spatially periodic 
structures require both GSL and FFTW.

The GPU-accelerated programs can only run on a computer with an
appropriate NVIDIA GPU. To compile or run these programs, the system 
must also have an NVIDIA CUDA development environment that provides 
the CUFFT fast Fourier transform library. 

## Compiling

Complete directions for compiling and installing PSCF are provided 
in section 2 of the html documentation. Short instructions for 
compiling, after installing all of the required dependencies, are 
given below:

   - Add the pscfpp/bin directory to your linux command search PATH
     environment variable.
   
   - Add the pscfpp/lib/python directory to your PYTHONPATH
     environment variable.
   
   - cd to the pscfpp/ root directory
   
   - Enter "./setup" from this root directory to run a setup script.
     This script installs default versions of several files that are 
     required by the build system. You only need to run the setup
     script once, before compiling the first time.

   - Change directory (cd) to the subdirectory pscfpp/bld/.
   
   - To compile and install only CPU-based programs in the package 
     (excluding GPU-accelerated programs), enter "make all-cpu"
   
   - To compile all programs, including the GPU-accelerated programs,
     on a machine that allows this, instead enter "make all". 

The setup script installs a default version of a file 
pscfpp/bld/config.mk that contains makefile variables that define 
compiler executable names, compiler options and paths to head and 
library files for external dependencies.  If the default options 
are not adequate, the user may edit this file as needed.

## Command line syntax (invoking a program)

PSCF is a package containing several different SCFT programs designed 
for different geometries, different algorithms or different hardware. 
Executable names (given above) are:

   - pscf_fd : 1D finite-difference program 

   - pscf_pcNd : CPU based programs for N=1,2, or 3 dimensional periodic
     structures

   - pscf_pgNd : GPU based programs for N=1,2, or 3 dimensional periodic
     structures

In the names pscf_pcdN and pscf_pgdN, N denotes a dimension dimension
of space that can be N=1, 2, 3. The CPU program for three-dimensionally
periodic microstructures is thus pscf_pc3d.

Each of these programs reads a parameter file and a command file. The 
parameter file is fixed-format file that contains parameters required 
to initialize the program. The command file is a more flexible script 
containing a sequence of commands that are read and executed sequentially 
to specify a sequence of computational steps.  The command file for 
a standard SCFT calculation also specifies the name of a file that 
contain an initial guess for monomer chemical potential fields and 
names of files to which final chemical potential and monomer 
concentration fields should be written.

The command line syntax for invoking any pscfp++ program that runs on
a CPU is:
```
program -p param -c command
```
where "program" denotes the name of the program, "param" denotes the 
path to a parameter file, and "command" denotes the path to a parameter 
file.  For example, one might enter
```
pscf_pc3d -p param -c command
```
to run the pscf_pc3d CPU program for three dimensional periodic structures. 
This form of the command would write log output to the screen.  Output 
produced during a computation may also be redirected to a log file by 
using the unix ">" standard output redirection operator. In addition, 
and -e command line option may also be used to cause the program to echo 
the parameter file to standard out as this file is read. With echoing and 
redirection, the command syntax would be 
```
program -e -p param -c command > log
```
where "log" denotes the name of a log file to which output will be
written during the computation.

The command line syntax to invoke the GPU-accelerated programs requires
two extra options that specify the number of CUDA blocks and the number
of blocks per thread. This is explained in the README file subdirectory
pscfpp/examples/pspg/, and in the examples contained in that directory.

## Examples

Directory pscfpp/examples contains a set of examples of simple 
calculations. Each example directory contains a parameter file (named
param), a command file (named command), and a input chemical potential 
(omega) file.  Top level subdirectories of pscfpp/examples contain 
examples for different PSCF programs. 

Subdirectory examples/fd1d subdirectory contains examples for the 1D 
finite-difference program pscf_fd. Top level subdirectories of 
examples/fd1d contain examples for planar, cylindrical and spherical 
geometries, as indicated by the subdirectory names. One or more example 
is given for each type of geometry.

Subdirectory examples/pspc contains examples contains examples the CPU 
based pscf_pcNd programs for N=1, 2 and 3. Top level subdirectories
contain solutions for a particular type of physical system, e.g.,
examples/pspc/diblock contains examples for a diblock copolymer melt. 
Subdirectories of examples/pspc/diblock contain examples for lamellar 
(N=1), hexagonal (N=2) and BCC (N=3) structures, each of which has a 
different number of spatially periodic dimensions.

Subdirectory examples/pspg contains examples examples for the pscf_pg3d 
3D GPU code for periodic structures.

Each example directory contains a script named "run" that can used to
run the example using the supplied input files and appropriate options. 
The simplest way to run an example is to change directory (cd) to the
directory containing the example and enter "./run" from that directory.
Users may also inspect the run file to see the command and options
require to run the program. Most example directories also contain a
script named "clean" that can be run to remove all output files 
created by running the example.
