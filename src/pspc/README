This directory contains code specific to a pseudo-spectral implementation 
of SCFT for periodic structures. The code is based on algorithms similar 
to those used in the original Fortran PSCF code. 

This C++ code, unlike the Fortran code, requires the user to invoke 
different executables for problems involving structures that are periodic 
in different numbers of dimensions.  The main executables for 1, 2 and 3 
dimensionally periodic structures are named pscf_ps1d, and pscf_ps2d and 
pscf_ps3d, respectively.  Examples of the usage of these programs are 
provided in the directory pscfpp/examples/pspc/diblock.

The usual command line usage for doing a 3D SCFT calculation (e.g., the 
one in directory examples/pspc/diblock/bcc) is to invoke

     pscf_ps3d -e -p param -c command

Here, "param" denotes the name of a parameter file and command denotes 
the name of a command file.  The -e option causes the parameter file 
to be echoed to standard output as it is read.  To perform a 2D (e.g.,
a hexagonal phase) or 1D calculation (a lamellar phase), instead invoke 
the executable pscf_ps2d or pscf_ps1d, respectively.
